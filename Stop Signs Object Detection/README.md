Right now, this code does object detection without involving PyCuda. I need to figure this out.

The relevant libraries for doing it through PyCuda are mentioned here already, but they've been commented for now.

If someone can help me out, that'll be pretty awesome.

Just reach out to me on my LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashnahkhan/
